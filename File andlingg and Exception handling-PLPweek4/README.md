# Python Exercises: File Handling and Exception Handling

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates file handling and basic exception handling in Python. The main challenge involves reading, processing, and writing text files.

## Challenge Details
### Task Requirements:
1. Create a file called `input.txt` and write at least five lines of text into it.
2. Write a Python script to:
   - Read the contents of `input.txt`.
   - Count the number of words in the file.
   - Convert all text to uppercase.
   - Write the processed text and the word count to a new file called `output.txt`.
   - Print a success message once the new file is created.

### Output:
- The processed text and word count are saved in `output.txt`.
- A success message is displayed in the terminal upon successful execution.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or open it in your development environment.
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/Python-Exercises/File andlingg and Exception handling-PLPweek4

   ```
4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python process_text.py
   ```

## Files in This Project
- `input.txt`: Contains the original text to be processed.
- `process_text.py`: The Python script that performs the file operations.
- `output.txt`: Contains the processed text and word count.

## Example Output
### `output.txt`:
```
THIS IS LINE 1.
THIS IS LINE 2.
THIS IS LINE 3.
THIS IS LINE 4.
THIS IS LINE 5.

Word Count: 15
```

### Terminal Output:
```
The file 'output.txt' has been successfully created with the processed content!
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- File reading and writing in Python.
- String manipulation (e.g., converting text to uppercase).
- Counting words in a file.
- Exception handling for robust file operations.
